# Project Title

BMCC Commute Optimizer

## Inspiration
Most BMCC students rely on the subway, and delays often cause stress. On top of that, finding a professor’s email, writing a message, and sending it while rushing is a headache. This app makes commuting and communicating much easier and convenient.
## What it does
The app lets students log in, select their home station and class, and see if they’ll be on time. It loads class schedules from JSON, uses auto-complete for all NYC stations, predicts lateness, suggests alternate train lines, and can auto-generate an email to the professor before the student is even late.
## Challenges
* Handling JSON login and class data
* Integrating subway stations from the MTA GTFS feed


## Accomplishments
* Working login system
* Station auto-complete
* Class loading and lateness prediction
* One-click professor email feature

## What I learned
* How to work with Qt Creator
* How to parse and use JSON files in C++
* How to structure a multi-page application
* How to auto-generate emails from user-selected data

## Built with
* C++ / Qt 
* JSON
* MTA GTFS data (from: data.gov)
* Jupyter Notebook (Python)
